Revised Todo (July 25, 2008):
 
 - Error checking for adding database aliases. How should general error handling work?

 - Add row adding/editing/deleting. (We have a basic implimentation currently.)
 
 - When displaying the phpsqliteadmin version, it should display the number within the configuration table of the phpsla.sqlite database.

 - (?) Reorganization of the main page: Main area should display phpsqliteadmin version, sqlite version, list all of the databases, have a database creation form/alias configuration links.
 
 - Newer layout... use something like $pg['content'] .= "content" to update content rather than using print. That way we only need one layout file, and a layout inclusion at the end of every page. The sidebar should have that phpsqliteadmin logo as well.

 - Better icons!

 - Feel free to add more. I was unsure of a few of entries in the old todo's.

 - Privilege checks for databases?
 
Old Todo:

- "browse" should have navigation buttons

- display of indexes fails sometimes

- display of table structure fails when columns are typeless (problem in the class)

- ui to create triggers

- ui to create views

- create a way to alter tables

- you name it! still many many stuff to do...

- add a warning if magic_quotes_gpc is ON

- finish "hoster-mode", which must play nicely with login

- make it xhtml 1.0 Transitional:
  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

- add multi-language support

- add ui to manager user accounts




THERE IS A BUG:

when you change the path to the file in an alias, the cookie gets not updated, and you still point to the
old database file!!!
Changing to another alias and coming back helps.


Notes about Steves branch:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

dbaction.php: this should go away:
$object = $_GET['object'];
$action = $_GET['action'];
