- you can add an alias database w/out the alias filled, which is bad...

- you can remove phpsla.sqlite alias, which is bad as well

- "browse" should have navigation buttons

- display of indexes fails sometimes

- display of table structure fails when columns are typeless (problem in the class)

- ui to create triggers

- ui to create views

- create a way to alter tables

- you name it! still many many stuff to do...

- add a warning if magic_quotes_gpc is ON

- finish "hoster-mode", which must play nicely with login

- make it xhtml 1.0 Transitional:
  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

- add multi-language support

- add ui to manager user accounts




THERE IS A BUG:

when you change the path to the file in an alias, the cookie gets not updated, and you still point to the
old database file!!!
Changing to another alias and coming back helps.


Notes about Steves branch:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

dbaction.php: this should go away:
$object = $_GET['object'];
$action = $_GET['action'];
